#Food and keeping active

A healthy diet and keeping active will help you manage your blood sugar level. They’ll also help you control your weight and generally feel better.

##You can eat many types of foods
There’s nothing you can’t eat, but you’ll have to limit certain foods.

You should:

- eat a wide range of foods - including fruit, vegetables, some starchy foods such as pasta
- keep the amount of sugar, fat and salt to a minimum
- eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day - don’t skip meals

If you need to change your diet, it might be easier to make small changes every week.
