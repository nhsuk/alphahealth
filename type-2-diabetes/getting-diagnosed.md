#Getting diagnosed
Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed following blood or urine tests for something else. 

However, if you have any [symptoms](/type-2-diabetes/check-if-you-have-it) you should see your GP straight away.

##Before your diagnosis
To find out if you have type 2 diabetes, you usually have to go through the following steps:

1. Speak to your GP about your symptoms.
2. Your GP will check your urine and arrange a blood test to check your blood sugar levels. It usually takes about 1 to 2 days for the results to come back.
3. If you have diabetes, your GP will ask you to come in again to explain the test results and what will happen next. 

##If you’re diagnosed with diabetes

What your GP will discuss with you during your initial appointment depends on the diagnosis and the treatment they recommend.

Generally, they’ll talk to you about:

- what diabetes is
- what high blood sugar means for your health
- what medication you’ll have to take
- your diet and exercise
- your lifestyle, for example alcohol and smoking

Your GP will do their best to discuss the diagnosis with you but this first appointment might only be 10 to 15 minutes long.

###If you have questions about your diagnosis
It’s usually difficult to take everything in the GP tells you during the appointment.

Talk to family and friends about what the GP told you and write down all the questions you have.

Then make another GP appointment and take your list of questions with you.

###Dealing with confusion and shock after the diagnosis
There’s also a lot of [information on diabetes](/type-2-diabetes/finding-help-and-support) available including how to find:

- support groups
- hospital courses about living with diabetes
- online forums and chat rooms where people with diabetes discuss how they manage their condition

1. Your GP will prescribe [medication](/type-2-diabetes/understanding-medication). It might take some time for you to get used to the medication and to find the right amounts for you.
