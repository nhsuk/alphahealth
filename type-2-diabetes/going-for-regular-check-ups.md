# Going for regular check ups

Type 2 diabetes check ups help to make sure your condition doesn’t lead to other health problems, eg with your eyesight, heart or your feet.

## Every 3 months

### Long-term blood sugar checks (HbA1C test)

Checks your average blood sugar levels and how close they are to normal.

You have these checks every 3 months when newly diagnosed, then every 6 months once you’re stable.

## What happens after your appointment

The person you have the appointment with, for example your diabetes nurse, will tell you how long it takes to get the test results and if you need to come in again.
